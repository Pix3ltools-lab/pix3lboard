# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in Pix3lBoard a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Behaviors That Contribute to a Positive Environment

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Being patient with those who are learning

### Unacceptable Behaviors

- Use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Best Practices for Contributors

### 1. Before Contributing

- **Read the documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the [README](README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- **Search existing issues**: Before opening a new issue, check if one already exists
- **Understand the architecture**: Pix3lBoard uses Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Turso. Make sure you're familiar with these technologies

### 2. Communication

- **Be clear and concise**: Describe problems and solutions in an understandable way
- **Provide context**: Include relevant information such as version, browser, operating system
- **Use templates**: Follow issue and pull request templates when available
- **Respond promptly**: If someone asks for clarification, try to respond in a reasonable timeframe

### 3. Code and Pull Requests

- **Follow existing conventions**:
  - TypeScript strict mode
  - Functional React components
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`)

- **Keep PRs focused**: A PR should solve a single problem or add a single feature
- **Write readable code**: Prefer clarity over brevity
- **Test your changes**: Verify that your code works correctly before submitting
- **Document significant changes**: Update documentation if necessary

### 4. Code Review

- **Be constructive**: Offer suggestions, not criticism
- **Explain the why**: When suggesting changes, explain your reasoning
- **Appreciate the work**: Acknowledge others' time and effort
- **Accept feedback**: Reviews are learning opportunities

### 5. Privacy-First Development Principles

Pix3lBoard is built with a privacy-first approach. When contributing:

- Do not introduce tracking or analytics without explicit consent
- Do not transmit data to external services unnecessarily
- Prefer solutions that keep data under user control
- Document any interactions with external services

### 6. Security

- **Don't expose secrets**: Never commit API keys, passwords, or sensitive data
- **Report vulnerabilities responsibly**: Contact maintainers privately for security issues
- **Validate inputs**: Prevent injection and other common vulnerabilities
- **Follow best practices**: Use existing authentication libraries, don't reinvent the wheel

## Maintainer Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team through GitHub issues. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html
